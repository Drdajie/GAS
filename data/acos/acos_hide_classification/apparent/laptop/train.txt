anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .####[([53, 54], 'HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [101, 102]), ([53, 54], 'HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [105, 106])]

you know , i wanted to love this machine .####[([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####[([11, 13], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####[([12, 13], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [16, 17])]
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .####[([17, 18], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
so one star off for the keyboard .####[([6, 7], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .####[([3, 5], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]

i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####[([7, 9], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####[([6, 7], 'COMPANY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]

initially the product lived up to the expectations .####[([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .####[([5, 8], 'SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1]), ([10, 14], 'SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[([41, 43], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####[([2, 3], 'HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]

i picked up the stylus and it fell apart , no drops no damage .####[([4, 5], 'HARDWARE#QUALITY', [0], [-1, -1])]
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####[([0, 1], 'COMPANY#GENERAL', [0], [2, 3])]
never again will i buy samsung products and thats what i ' d suggest here .####[([5, 7], 'COMPANY#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
no caps lock on the keyboard .####[([5, 6], 'KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####[([3, 4], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [7, 8])]
apps have to close and be reopened to get them to a somewhat decent size .####[([0, 1], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]
chrome os is not matured in any way .####[([0, 2], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[([27, 28], 'OS#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]
google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####[([0, 1], 'COMPANY#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####[([4, 5], 'OS#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
apps are glitchy .####[([0, 1], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [0], [2, 3])]
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####[([25, 26], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [2], [16, 17]), ([24, 26], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####[([1, 2], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .####[([2, 4], 'HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .####[([16, 17], 'PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .####[([2, 4], 'PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1]), ([17, 19], 'PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####[([1, 2], 'HARDWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [19, 20])]
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .####[([15, 16], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [0], [14, 15])]
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .####[([7, 8], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [9, 10]), ([7, 8], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [13, 14])]
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .####[([9, 11], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [2, 3])]
a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####[([5, 8], 'MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####[([2, 3], 'MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [7, 8])]
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####[([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4]), ([23, 24], 'MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [19, 20]), ([29, 31], 'CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [25, 26])]
the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [4, 5])]
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####[([5, 8], 'PORTS#CONNECTIVITY', [2], [4, 5])]
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####[([18, 19], 'CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [12, 13])]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[([5, 8], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [20, 21])]
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####[([24, 26], 'MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [23, 24])]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[([0, 1], 'COMPANY#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .####[([2, 3], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [11, 12]), ([4, 5], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [11, 12])]
anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )####[([16, 17], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [-1, -1]), ([22, 26], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [2], [21, 22])]
for an office , you can give everyone a chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign - out , and the machines can also be remotely managed if you ' re a google apps customer .####[([9, 10], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [-1, -1])]
for students and road warriors , the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync - ing a breeze , especially if you hotspot from your phone .####[([8, 10], 'BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date####[([26, 27], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [25, 26])]
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####[([1, 2], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [2], [8, 9])]
the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .####[([1, 3], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [2], [7, 8])]

the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .####[([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [5, 6]), ([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [10, 11])]
however , know what you ' re buying before you get a chromebook : it operates on a chrome operating system and you can ' t install apps or games on it like world of warcraft .####[([12, 13], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [1], [-1, -1])]
screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare !####[([0, 2], 'DISPLAY#QUALITY', [2], [3, 4])]
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####[([1, 6], 'KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [11, 12])]
first off the chromebook itself is excellent , one of the few budget models with 1080p and a long battery life .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [6, 7]), ([19, 21], 'BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [18, 19])]

that machine couldn ' t handle all the tabs i wanted to keep open , so after much research , i jumped into this acer .####[([24, 25], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####[([9, 10], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [2], [11, 12]), ([14, 15], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [2], [16, 17]), ([20, 21], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [22, 23]), ([27, 28], 'KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [29, 30])]

never has it run out of power while on battery .####[([9, 10], 'BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]

where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .####[([8, 10], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [2], [-1, -1])]

the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .####[([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [4, 5]), ([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [6, 7])]
the force touch trackpad works great .####[([1, 4], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [2], [5, 6])]
overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .####[([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [7, 8])]
it feels sturdy and reliable , both hardware and software - wise .####[([7, 8], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [2], [2, 3]), ([7, 8], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5]), ([9, 10], 'SOFTWARE#GENERAL', [2], [2, 3]), ([9, 10], 'SOFTWARE#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5])]
i waited for a while before writing a review about this product .####[([11, 12], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
after a couple of months of using this product , i finally could say that it ' s the best thing that i have ever bought up to this moment .####[([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [19, 20])]
regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged , the inside box was fine .####[([6, 8], 'SHIPPING#GENERAL', [0], [9, 10]), ([12, 14], 'SHIPPING#GENERAL', [2], [15, 16])]
i use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it ' s just great .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [19, 20])]
therefore , my advice to you if you ' re a student and you need a laptop for school , this laptop is the best choice for you .####[([16, 17], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [24, 25])]
and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .####[([8, 9], 'OS#USABILITY', [2], [30, 32])]
amazon warehouse marked this as ` ` like new ` ` but upon receiving , this unit was brand new .####[([15, 17], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1])]
at the time of this posting , this model was going only for 1800 for the 512gb with a dedicated video card .####[([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
win for the ports , win for the price , and win for a brand new unopened macbook .####[([3, 4], 'PORTS#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1]), ([17, 18], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1])]
love love love this laptop !####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [1, 2]), ([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [2, 3]), ([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
the display is excellent !####[([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4])]
you can actually take a picture of this screen and not have near the amount of wavy lines that you used to get .####[([8, 9], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
i really like the fact that when it boots up , it ' s up .####[([8, 10], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [2, 3])]
this thing boots up , you log in and you ' re ready to go !####[([2, 4], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
if you ' re considering a switch from windows based pcs to apple computers , i ' d probably recommend that you look at what you ' re going to use it for .####[([12, 14], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
fantastic computer !####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [0, 1])]
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .####[([7, 8], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [9, 10])]
i have had three macbook pro ' s and all have been excellent .####[([4, 8], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [12, 13])]
the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .####[([1, 3], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [7, 8])]
this is my first ever macbook and i will never go back .####[([5, 6], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1])]
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [1], [-1, -1])]
the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .####[([1, 3], 'BATTERY#GENERAL', [2], [6, 7])]
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .####[([1, 2], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .####[([1, 3], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5])]
the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .####[([11, 12], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [2, 3]), ([34, 38], 'SOFTWARE#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1]), ([41, 42], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .####[([0, 2], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]
i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .####[([4, 5], 'COMPANY#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .####[([8, 12], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [2, 3])]
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .####[([3, 4], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [1, 2])]
overall , it ' s a great machine .####[([7, 8], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [6, 7])]
battery life is good , screen looks fine , and all of the keys and ports are functional .####[([0, 2], 'BATTERY#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4]), ([5, 6], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [2], [7, 8]), ([13, 14], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [17, 18]), ([15, 16], 'PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [17, 18])]
the only thing i didn ' t like is the big dent on the front of the lid .####[([11, 12], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [5, 8])]
as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .####[([7, 8], 'GRAPHICS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [10, 11])]
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .####[([21, 22], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [24, 25])]
with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .####[([18, 19], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [15, 16])]
nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .####[([6, 9], 'OS#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .####[([11, 12], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
one of the first things i noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that i ask of it .####[([11, 12], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [14, 15]), ([11, 12], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [16, 17])]
- love the trackpad .####[([3, 4], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4])]
- retina display is nice but not mind blowing as other have suggested####[([1, 3], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [1], [4, 5])]
the screen is crisp and clear , easy to set up .####[([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [3, 4]), ([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [5, 6]), ([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#USABILITY', [2], [7, 8])]

i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .####[([16, 18], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [0], [31, 32])]

it boots up instantaneously .####[([1, 3], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [3, 4])]
my father is very satisfied with this laptop####[([7, 8], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5])]

it ' s a little weird at first , knowing that the button isn ' t actually moving when you click down , but you definitely get used to it .####[([12, 13], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]
the mac pro is also very fast , and i have only experienced the rainbow wheel once or twice whenever i was on a website that wasn ' t responding .####[([1, 3], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [6, 7])]
but so far this laptop has been up to its expectations .####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]

when i first got it in the mail and i opened it up and turned it on for the first time , i was a little speechless because the retina display looks so good !####[([29, 31], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [2], [33, 34])]
very clean computer everything looks brand new !####[([2, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [1, 2])]

this computer is amazing .####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4])]
the battery life is outstanding .####[([1, 3], 'BATTERY#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5])]
the internal flash memory is like greased lightning .####[([2, 4], 'MEMORY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .####[([7, 8], 'KEYBOARD#USABILITY', [0], [3, 4])]
if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [24, 25])]
i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [21, 22])]
since you have access to android apps on the google play store , you don ' t have to rely solely on the chrome browser to access apps .####[([5, 7], 'SOFTWARE#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
i haven ' t had issues with the track pad as others have .####[([8, 10], 'HARDWARE#USABILITY', [1], [-1, -1])]
i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .####[([4, 6], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [2], [9, 10])]
well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !####[([15, 17], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [11, 12])]
and the blue mail email app handles my multiple emails from multiple domains .####[([2, 6], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [2], [-1, -1])]
i ' m a writer , and this has easily become my main computer for both work and play ( google docs easily replaces word , and android apps make it much better for gaming than i originally expected ) .####[([27, 29], 'SOFTWARE#USABILITY', [2], [32, 33])]
the battery life is great ( i get about 9 hours ) .####[([1, 3], 'BATTERY#GENERAL', [2], [4, 5])]
my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .####[([8, 9], 'HARDWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
overall i love this machine , and all my computers will probably be chromebooks in the future .####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [2, 3])]
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! )####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS', [2], [-1, -1])]
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [2], [7, 8])]
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .####[([8, 9], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]
the touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but i was quickly in the google play store , downloading all the apps i have on my phone and linking them to my accounts .####[([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1]), ([4, 5], 'KEYBOARD#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .####[([4, 5], 'SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [9, 10])]
i was using my whole $ 3k desktop on this little $ 250 laptop and it ran flawlessly !####[([13, 14], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [17, 18])]
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .####[([9, 10], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [-1, -1])]
for $ 250 i can control my $ 3000 pc anywhere .####[([9, 10], 'LAPTOP#PORTABILITY', [2], [-1, -1])]
this is the ultimate tablet .####[([4, 5], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .####[([10, 11], 'KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1]), ([13, 14], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [12, 13]), ([18, 19], 'PORTS#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1])]
you can right - click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time ( or 2 fingers on the touchpad , using one of them to press press down / click the touchpad ) .####[([24, 25], 'HARDWARE#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
the feel of the touchpad is not as smooth ( frictionless ) as others i have used , but it ' s not terrible either .####[([4, 5], 'KEYBOARD#USABILITY', [1], [22, 24])]
the screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it .####[([1, 2], 'DISPLAY#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
reserve your judgement until you ' ve updated the software entirely .####[([9, 10], 'SOFTWARE#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
i love the feel of a lighter os and can do many tasks using google / web based apps .####[([7, 8], 'OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [1, 2])]
i can live with the so - so touchpad since the rest of it feels solid / sturdy .####[([8, 9], 'KEYBOARD#USABILITY', [1], [5, 8]), ([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [15, 16]), ([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [17, 18])]
yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [1], [-1, -1])]
although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .####[([4, 5], 'MEMORY#QUALITY', [1], [-1, -1]), ([21, 22], 'SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [20, 21])]
my wife upgraded from the 2 gigs of ram version to this , and it seems like there is more than twice the performance .####[([8, 9], 'MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [-1, -1])]
the screen is pleasantly satisfying with the touch screen and foldability .####[([8, 9], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [3, 4]), ([8, 9], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [4, 5])]
the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .####[([1, 3], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [21, 22])]
this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [16, 17])]
i ' m amazed at this product that has the same build as the other acer chromebooks .####[([6, 7], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [3, 4])]
we are happy to be selling her old one we bought just a few months ago , in replacement of this new r11 !####[([22, 23], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [2, 3])]
1st , i was shocked at how easy it was to set up .####[([11, 13], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [7, 8])]
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .####[([13, 15], 'MEMORY#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .####[([8, 9], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [12, 13])]
amazon , as well as the google suite of docs , sheets , slides , and photos work great .####[([0, 1], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [18, 19]), ([6, 8], 'SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [18, 19])]
there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .####[([6, 8], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [5, 6]), ([13, 15], 'KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [15, 18])]
this by far has been the easiest to set up and use .####[([8, 10], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [6, 7])]
gates and this machine allows me to do this .####[([3, 4], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
of course , i have only had this acer for a week .####[([8, 9], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [1], [-1, -1])]
i am very happy with my chromebook !####[([6, 7], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [3, 4])]
customer service did not respond for almost a week , and i ended up paying + $ 20 in shipping to return the device .####[([0, 2], 'SUPPORT#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1]), ([23, 24], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
the screen just went blank and would not shut down , stayed in a cycle that would bring up some gray screen and then just turn itself into sleep mode .####[([21, 22], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
this model has a defect .####[([1, 2], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [4, 5])]
