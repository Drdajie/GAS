yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####[([-1, -1], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [0], [6, 7])]
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [0], [-1, -1])]
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]

it ' s hard to navigate and i had to buy a usb mouse and a usb connector .####[([-1, -1], 'HARDWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [3, 4])]
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [3, 4])]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [1, 2])]

needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####[([-1, -1], 'OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
if you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred bucks for that , rock on .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [0], [-1, -1])]
the problem is that it never charged .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [0], [3, 4])]
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [0, 1])]
it calls itself a computer , but it ' s really not .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####[([-1, -1], 'DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [12, 13])]
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [2], [39, 40])]
it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [4, 5])]
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [2, 3]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [39, 40]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS', [2], [16, 17])]
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
thus far , i am very happy with the purchase , and highly recommend it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [6, 7]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [13, 14])]
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [2], [5, 6]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [2], [12, 13])]

it arrived in ` ` as new ` ` condition despite being a refurbished ( likely a return ) .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
it is a steal at $ 179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [8, 9])]
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [9, 10])]

it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [2], [7, 8])]
it does not interface well with any printer i could find as nothing would download for a driver because it needs to be a mac or windows .####[([-1, -1], 'OS#USABILITY', [0], [-1, -1])]

i wanted something i could work on my writing projects on the go , so i paid the $ 250 for this thing .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [1], [-1, -1])]

giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]

i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
i packaged it right back up and sent it back the same day i got it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
i only used it work my college school work and light browsing .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [1], [-1, -1])]

worked great for a couple of months , but now the sound goes in and out after a couple minutes of use like watching a video or playing music .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [1, 2])]

i will probably be sending it back as it seems too complicated .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [11, 12])]
by far this is the most disappointing experiences that i ever had doing online shopping .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [6, 7])]
but seemed very poorly made for the money .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#QUALITY', [0], [3, 4])]

game performance was fantastic .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [3, 4])]

whether i ' m playing games or video editing , or web design , it doesn ' t hesitate .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS', [2], [-1, -1])]
i ' m not a huge gamer , but it can run crysis with full mods on ultra settings and doesn ' t make so much as a light hum .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
your mileage may vary but it ' s been a headache for me since i bought it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [10, 11])]
it ' s fast , but the whole thing is wearing out quickly .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [3, 4])]
however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
i did not get what i originally paid for .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
not to mention it is quite clunky and large .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [6, 7]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [8, 9])]
everything about the experience has been terrible .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [6, 7])]
i had this for all of a day before it began to have severe issues i set it back to factory settings and that worked for a time but it eventually had an issue with system 32 .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [12, 13])]
the last straw happened recently when i put it to sleep and it just wouldn ' t wake up - or rather it would try , and then spend the next several hours in a repair / analyzing mode that didn ' t actually do anything .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
i have had nothing but problems with it since i bought it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]

i can no longer return it and have wasted $ 850 , the support refuses to get back in touch or provide any form of civility .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .####[([-1, -1], 'OS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]

this was a christmas present and now we ' re scrambling because it sucks .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [13, 14])]
i bought this in august and i have had to completely wipe 2x and rollback after every critical update since november .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
it was crashing , it would restart and then the monitor would not work until i plugged it into an external one , and even then it would usually require a restart again .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [2, 3])]
i returned this one as well .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
it is not a great build .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [2, 5])]
i had high hopes but sadly i had to return the second as well .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [5, 6])]

i read a lot about people getting doa versions of this product from the reviews and thought i got a pretty good one until now .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [21, 22])]
most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps , browser , etc .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [7, 8])]
they ' re like a little - known gem , practically unknown in my area .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [8, 9])]
