the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !####[([-1, -1], 'SERVICE#GENERAL', [0], [9, 10])]
to top it all off . . the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .####[([-1, -1], 'SERVICE#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1]), ([-1, -1], 'RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS', [0], [-1, -1])]

at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .####[([-1, -1], 'SERVICE#GENERAL', [2], [-1, -1])]
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .####[([-1, -1], 'SERVICE#GENERAL', [2], [6, 7])]
