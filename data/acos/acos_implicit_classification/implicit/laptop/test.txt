great price and great performance but terrible battery .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [-1, -1]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [-1, -1])]
it is a little slow .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [4, 5])]
after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .####[([-1, -1], 'DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES', [1], [-1, -1])]
it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [2, 3]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [5, 6]), ([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [-1, -1])]
i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .####[([-1, -1], 'OS#DESIGN_FEATURES', [0], [-1, -1])]
hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#USABILITY', [0], [0, 1])]
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [0], [4, 5])]
look , dont buy it .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]

then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .####[([-1, -1], 'KEYBOARD#GENERAL', [0], [-1, -1])]
at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [7, 8])]

i love it !####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#GENERAL', [2], [1, 2])]
overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', [2], [4, 5])]
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [2], [27, 28])]
i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .####[([-1, -1], 'LAPTOP#PRICE', [1], [2, 3])]
